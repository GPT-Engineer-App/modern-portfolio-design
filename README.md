# modern-portfolio-design

Create a modern and professional personal portfolio website design that includes the following elements:

The layout should be a single page with smooth scrolling navigation. Include sections for services, portfolio, testimonials, blog, and a contact form.
At the top, there should be a sticky navigation bar with links to the different sections of the page and a 'Connect' button aligned to the right, which stands out.
The hero section should have a welcoming statement such as 'I Build Custom Website Solutions That Help Your Business Grow' in large, bold, blue font. Underneath, add a supportive tagline in smaller text.
Incorporate a professional, smiling headshot of a person in a circular frame overlapping the bottom edge of the hero section.
Use a color scheme that includes white for the background, a light blue for the hero section, and a darker blue for text and buttons.
Buttons should be rectangular with rounded corners, and use a contrasting color that stands out against the background, like dark blue with white text.
The 'Start a project' button should be more prominent than the 'See my work' button.
Include subtle dotted patterns or graphics in the background of the hero section for a modern look.
For typography, use a clean sans-serif font for headings and body text.
Ensure the layout is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
The HTML should be structured with semantic tags, and the CSS should utilize Flexbox or Grid for layout purposes. Include subtle animations for interactive elements such as buttons and links to enhance the user experience.
